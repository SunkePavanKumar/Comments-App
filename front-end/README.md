# Nested Comments React App (Frontend with Dummy Data)

This project implements a simple interactive comments section with nested replies using React.js. Comments are currently stored in the frontend using dummy data for testing.

## Features

- **View Comments:** See existing comments with username, content, upvotes/downvotes, and time.
- **Add Comment:** Post new comments with username and content.
- **Reply to Comments:** Create threaded conversations by replying to comments.
- **Edit Comment:** Edit your own comments.
- **Delete Comment:** Delete your own comments.
- **Upvote/Downvote:** React to comments by upvoting or downvoting.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling the components.
- **Local State:** Comments and replies are managed in the frontend using React's `useState` hook.
- **Dummy Data:** Comment data is initially populated using dummy objects for testing purposes.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the application:
  - `App.js`: Main component managing the overall structure and state.
  - `components/`: Reusable components:
    - `CommentList.js`: Renders a list of comments.
    - `Comment.js`: Displays an individual comment, handles editing, deleting, and replying.
    - `AddCommentForm.js`: Form for adding new comments and replies.
- `public/`: Contains static assets (e.g., index.html).

## Future Enhancements

- **Connect to Backend:** Replace dummy data with API calls to a Node.js backend with MongoDB to persist comments.
