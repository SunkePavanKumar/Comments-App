# Interactive Nested Comments App (Frontend with Dummy Data)

This React.js project demonstrates a user-friendly comments section with nested reply functionality. Comments and replies are managed using local state and dummy data, providing a foundation for future integration with a backend database.

## Features

- **View Comments:** Display a list of comments with user names, content, upvotes, downvotes, and timestamps.
- **Add Comment:** Create new comments with user name and content.
- **Reply to Comments:** Create threaded conversations by replying directly to comments.
- **Nested Replies:** Replies can have further replies, allowing for multiple levels of nesting.
- **Edit Comment:** Modify the content of your own comments.
- **Delete Comment:** Remove your own comments and any associated replies.
- **Upvote/Downvote:** React to comments by expressing approval or disapproval.
- **Responsive Design:** The interface adapts to various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.
- **Dynamic UI:** Smooth transitions and interactive elements enhance user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsiveness.
- **useState Hook:** For managing component state (comments data, UI interactions).

## Future Enhancements
